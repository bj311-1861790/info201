# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants
# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as
# factors!

# the dataset

# function.
